# Hello_World
The tutorial made me do this

I am a past PC/printer repair tech, software trainer, telecommunications project manager, publications designer, webmaster, writer/editor, and freelance consultant. Often self-employed, or running a side business but currently work at a university managing the student records and registration database. I'm 1) looking for a new challenge and 2) thinking it is time to expand my long flirtation with coding and design into a more permanent relationship.
